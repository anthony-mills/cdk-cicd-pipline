# CDK AWS CICD Pipelines

This is a collection of simple CICD pipelines using the AWS range of development services.

These services are provisioned with the [Amazon Cloud Development Kit ( CDK )](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/).

Simply choose the pipeline you would like to create and follow the instructions to deploy.

### Available Pipelines:

[Static HTML website](static_s3_pipeline/README.md) - Creates a code commit repo for a static HTML website and deploys to a public S3 bucket. 

Changes merged to the main branch of the git repository will be sent for manual approval and then deployed using the AWS CodePipeline service.
